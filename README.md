# FCC-Build-a-Technical-Documentation
Good practice of html and some new/reviewed CSS concepts.
Lots of HTML but also understanding the core CSS concepts and utilizing CSS grid as well as practicing media queries. Really understanding it and just need to keep on praciticing and building more projects. 

Some things that I learned :
-scrollbar-gutter property: which is basically allowing the gap for the scroll bar to be there. That was why it wasn't showing the scroll initially up until I put that value. Its also paired with overflow: auto and that is what also makes the scroll.
-practice display: grid template columns: and for each numerical value it was considered a column so for ex I did display: grid, grid-template-columns: 246px 1fr, which means that one column is going to be 246 and the 1fr is the telling me taking ther remaning space.
- Also learned that max-width was responsive meaning its going to that max-width and stay there but still be able to grow. Width is going to stay fixed amd stay there no matter what.
- Also learned when im creating a container the reason the text overflow is because its a fixed height. nothing wrong with that can just but overflowX: hidden; for the scroll but if don't want the scroll dont set fixed height so it can expand on its own and utilizing line height and padding to give it that illusion.
- position: sticky need auto-self property for it to properly function and used it on the header for the left column.
- overflow: auto will set the scroll bar;
- little reminder that the nav bar it starts with the # for linking and using the id to name it.
- did a page layout and also learned for the body don't adding the padding in the padding but rather put it on the hero for property HTML semantic structuring.
